## Installation

Simply download `robots.txt` and upload it to the root of your domain.

## Rules

- Search engines, social networks, and free research databases are allowed
- AI crawlers must credit sources by default
- If a bot is sometimes used for uncredited AI crawlers, it's not allowed
- If a bot is never used for uncredited AI crawlers but another bot from the
  same company is, it's still allowed
